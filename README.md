We all know 'Meroshare' sucks. Logging into Meroshare after 10 failed attempts just to find out that there's no IPOs? No thanks.
Its a simple script to automate this process. It will run every x minutes and sends notification to the slack channel if there are any new IPO openings.

WORK IN PROGRESS...  
Need 1 more hour to integrate slack and do some error handling but i have lost all interest to do so.
